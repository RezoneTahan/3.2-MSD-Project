# 3.2-MSD-Project
 Home Sequrity System
 
#**Objective:**
The main purpose of a home security system is to minimize break-ins from the
burglars. Home security system also provides protection of our possessions of
things and also our protection of ourselves. Again, Home security system helps
us to avoid danger from all types of circumstances.

#**Social Values:**
When we look at our family, and our home, we know we want them to be safe,
always out of harm’s way. When we leave for work, we expect to come back to
a smiling family, and to a home that is secure. But as they say, hope is not a
strategy. The growing crime rates across cities reflects the bitter reality. Many
people overlook, ignore, and underestimate the need of taking appropriate
home security measures. A burglary or theft can lead to devastating
consequences, both emotionally and financially. Having a security system in
place often provides family members with enough warning to get to a safe
location in our outside the home while the alarm system dispatches local
authorities.

**Required Components:**
These following parts and tools are required for building this project
❖ Arduino Mega 2560
❖ PIR Motion Sensor
❖ LCD 16*2
❖ Keypad 4*3
2
❖ Servo Motor
❖ Buzzer
❖ Jumper Wire
❖ LED
❖ Breadboard
❖ Transistor

**Working Procedure:**
The basic components that react to the input are
 Servo motor
It controls the movement of door to be opened or closed.
 LCD display
To show the message of current status.
 Keypad
To provide password for locking door.
 PIR Sensor
Senses any movement of unwanted intruder.
 Buzzer
Alarm rings for the consequence of unwanted event.
